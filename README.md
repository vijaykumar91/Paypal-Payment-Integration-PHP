"# Paypal-Payment-Integration-PHP" 
I have written the full code to integrate the paypal gatway integration
by using the client ID and secret of paypal.

Pull the code from git repo in your system
after that create a mysql database in phpmyadmin now import the sql file after creating database.
now insert at least one record in product table
put your credentials of paypal
After that run the code inside the php enviorment 
If all the credentials wil correct then it will be work perfectly.

Stay connected with us
Thanks & regards
Vijay Kumar
